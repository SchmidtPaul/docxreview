# docxreview: Extract Review Feedback from Word Documents

Extract comments and tracked changes from reviewed Word documents
(.docx) and return them as structured data or formatted Markdown.
Designed for workflows where documents are rendered from Quarto or R
Markdown, reviewed in Microsoft Word, and feedback needs to be processed
programmatically — particularly with Claude Code and btw for AI-assisted
review processing.
