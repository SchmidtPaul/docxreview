Description: Extract comments and tracked changes from reviewed Word
    documents (.docx) and return them as structured data or formatted
    Markdown. Designed for workflows where documents are rendered from
    Quarto or R Markdown, reviewed in Microsoft Word, and feedback needs
    to be processed programmatically — particularly with Claude Code
    and btw for AI-assisted review processing.
